# Example Application

## 🚀 Overview  
Welcome to the Example Inc application! This is a React-based app that offers navigation between a Home page and a User page. The User page allows you to view a list of users fetched from a test API, as well as edit and delete these users. The app is set up with actions to add the functionality for adding new users in the future. With these foundational building blocks and structure in place, the goal is to easily expand the app by following a similar pattern for future modules and pages.
